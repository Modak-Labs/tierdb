# Architecture

Modak is two deployable halves and a contract between them.

## The two halves

The extension (`extension/`, Rust) runs inside the Postgres backend. It owns
everything that must happen at query time: the transparent-read planner hook
(swapping each registered relation for the two-tier union subquery, Postgres'
own view-expansion recipe), the write routers (`modak_upsert`/`modak_delete`),
and read-pin acquire and release. The pure consistency logic (planner, SQL
generation, merge rules) lives in a separate crate, `modak-core`, with no
Postgres dependency, so it unit-tests without a database.

The worker (`worker/`, Java) runs alongside Postgres and owns everything that
moves data: tiering (seal, flush, advance, reclaim), the CDC mirror pumps,
compaction (folding the delta into equality deletes), initial copies, lake
maintenance, and verification. Lake access goes through pluggable ports
(`modak-lake-api`) with Iceberg as the shipped implementation. The console
binary embeds the same daemon and adds the web UI.

## The coordination boundary

The halves never call each other. They communicate through the `modak.*`
catalog tables in your database, and every consistency-critical handoff is one
plain Postgres transaction:

- The cut-line advance updates `T`, `S`, and the lake's `metadata_location`
  atomically, so a reader pins either the old world or the new one, never a
  mix.
- The compaction publish clears folded delta rows in the same transaction that
  advances `S`, version-guarded so a row re-corrected mid-fold survives.
- The mirror frontier advance commits only after the lake commit it describes,
  and replication-slot feedback is sent strictly after that. The slot can only
  trim WAL the catalog already owns.

This is the single most important structural decision: the `(T, S)` handoff is
atomic because Postgres transactions are, and each half can be built, tested,
and deployed independently.

## The consistency contract

Reads are correct because four invariants hold:

1. `T` and `S` are monotonic and move together. A regressing advance throws,
   and the catalog is the arbiter.
2. Reads pin. A query holds `(T, S)` in `modak.read_pins` for its
   transaction, and pins roll back with it.
3. Nothing pinned is mutated. Compaction skips tables with active pins below
   its target, snapshot expiry never touches the oldest pinned horizon, and
   partition reclaim waits out pins below the new line.
4. Every data movement is idempotent and journaled. Tiering and compaction
   record phases in `modak.op_log`, and crash recovery replays or adopts
   (pre-commit gap probes reconcile a lake snapshot the catalog never learned
   about). Initial copies journal chunks and resume exactly.

Failure of any component therefore degrades to lag, never to a wrong answer.
A dead worker stops advancing the seam, and readers keep reading the pinned
world.

## Execution

Cold scans run in DuckDB via `pg_duckdb`, reading the pinned
`metadata_location` directly (no catalog round-trip on the read path). DuckDB
is the vectorized executor of a fully resolved plan. Modak decides what is
current, DuckDB never does. Generated SQL stays executor-portable because
`pg_duckdb` may push the whole query down.
